    - `Manage Roles`
    - `Manage Channels`
    - `Send Messages`
    - `Read Message History`

## üìå Important Notes

- **Database Security:** The current implementation does not encrypt the database. It is recommended to use SQLite encryption extensions or migrate to a more secure database system for storing sensitive information.
- **Password Storage:** Passwords are stored in plaintext. It's crucial to hash passwords using a secure hashing algorithm like bcrypt before storing them in the database.
- **Environment Variables:** Ensure that your `.env` file is not exposed publicly. Use `.gitignore` to prevent it from being committed to your repository.
- **Error Handling:** Improve error handling throughout the application to provide more detailed error messages and logging.
- **Scalability:** As the user base grows, consider optimizing database queries and possibly switching to a more robust database system.

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

- **Encryption for Database:** Implement encryption for the SQLite database to enhance security.
- **Password Hashing:** Integrate a password hashing mechanism such as bcrypt.
- **Enhanced Logging:** Add robust logging mechanisms to track and debug issues effectively.
- **Role-Based Access Control:** Implement more granular role-based access control for various commands.
- **Unit Tests:** Add unit tests to ensure the reliability and stability of the bot's functionality.
